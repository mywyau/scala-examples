users and groups

sudo gives admin privileges for a single command

sudo useradd -m jane
/etc/skel      skeleton directory for new users
ls -a

sudo passwd jane    create temp password for new user

assign authority of resources to a group and assign users as members to a group

when in /etc/skel

sudo mkdir /var/secret  example important directory
sudo groupadd secret-group
sudo chown :secret-group /var/secret/
sudo usermod -a -G secret-group jane    -G means to existing group  add jane to secret group
sudo chmod g+w /var/secret/      g+w add write permissions

jane can do whatever she wants to the contents to the files (resources) of secret group



linux file permissions

owner
group
all users


permissions types

permission types can be combined or be used as restrictions for certain users/groups

read       refers to ability to read contents of a file but cannot necessarily write
write       refers to ability to write contents of a file but cannot necessarily read
execute    execute/run a file and or view it's contents

you can check file permissions by using the 'ls -l' command whilst working in a directory you wish to check

The permission in the command line is displayed as: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group  example

_ denotes the first variable character which is a special permissions flag which can vary
first 3 letters rwx is owner permissions
second 3 letters rwx is group permissions
last 3 letters rwx is all users permissions

the '1' or integer after the last set of rwx displays the number of hardlinks to the file
finally the last piece is the owner and group assignment formatted as owner:group   probs who the owner is and the group the permissions are referring to

explicit permission definition

u - owner
g - group
o - others
a - all users

r - read
w - write
x - execute

so e.g. _rw_rw_rw 1 mikey/coolClub
so all three owner, group and all users have read and write access this file or directory is non-executable

so for exmaple we wish to remove the read and write permissions for all users

we enter the    chmod (changemod)   chmod a-rw file1     minus sign to remove rwx permissions
                                    chmod a+rw file1     plus sign to add the rw permissions
                                    chmod g+wx file2     will add write and executable to file2 for groups
