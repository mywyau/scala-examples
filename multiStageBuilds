small images

less attack surface
minimal OS and packages

usually start with a bloated image

docker container run
docker run

docker container run -it alpine sh   // -it "interactive terminal" lets you log into the container

will pull down alpine image, spin up a container and attach your terminal cursor to the shell in the container

ctrl+p+q

docker container run -d alpine sleep 1d        detached or daemon mode so will not grab your terminal like the prior command, sleep command tells it to stop running for a while

docker container stop <id/name>          status == Exited     id can be a few characters for uniqueness, stop does not remove data
docker container start <id/name>         uptime

docker container exec -it 60 sh    exec starts a new additional process
