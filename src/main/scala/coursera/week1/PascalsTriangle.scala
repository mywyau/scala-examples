    The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it
    Write a function that computes the elements of Pascalâ€™s triangle by means of a recursive process.
    Do this exercise by implementing the pascal function in Main.scala, which takes a column c and a row r,
    counting from 0 and returns the number at that spot in the triangle.
    For example, pascal(0,2) =1, pascal(1,2) =2 and pascal(1,3) =3.
