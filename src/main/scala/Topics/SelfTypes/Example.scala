class Example {

  /*  Self-types are a way to declare that a trait must be mixed into another trait, even though it doesnâ€™t directly extend it.
      That makes the members of the dependency available without imports.
      A self-type is a way to narrow the type of this or another identifier that aliases this.
      The syntax looks like normal function syntax but means something entirely different.
      To use a self-type in a trait, write an identifier, the type of another trait to mix in, and a => (e.g. someIdentifier: SomeOtherTrait =>).
      */

  trait User {
    def username: String
  }

  trait Tweeter {
    this: User => //reassign this    makes username in scope of Tweeter
    def tweet(tweetText: String): Unit = println(s"$username: $tweetText") //username is from User trait
  }

  class VerifiedTweeter(val username_ : String) extends Tweeter with User { // we mixin User because Tweeter requires it
    def username = s"real $username_"
  }

  val realBeyonce = new VerifiedTweeter("Beyonce")
  realBeyonce.tweet("Just spilled my glass of lemonade") // prints "real Beyonce: Just spilled my glass of lemonade"

  /*
  Because we said this: User => in trait Tweeter, now the variable username is in scope for the tweet method.
  This also means that since VerifiedTweeter extends Tweeter, it must also mix-in User (using with User).
