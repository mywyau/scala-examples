-- NULL

-- null mean does not equal to anything, it represents no value, similar to scala Unit
-- distinct operator treats all null the same, therefore the distinct operator keeps only one null in the result

-- e.g. if this employees phone_number column had multiple nulls then DISTINCT would return only a single null

select distinct phone_number
from employees
order by phone_number
